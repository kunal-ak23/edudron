      # CRITICAL: Set to 0 to force ALL file uploads to disk immediately (no memory buffering)
      # This prevents OOM errors for large files (700MB+). Without this, Spring Boot would buffer
      # files in memory up to the threshold, which could cause container memory issues.
      # 
      # IMPORTANT: Even with this setting, Spring Boot's multipart parser may still buffer
      # the request body in memory before writing to disk. To be safe, we use temp files:
      # 1. Spring Boot writes multipart file to temp file (on disk)
      # 2. We stream from temp file to Azure (minimal memory usage)
      # 3. Temp file is cleaned up after upload
      #
      # Memory usage: Only small buffers for streaming (~KB), NOT the entire file size
      #
      # PROGRESS TRACKING: XMLHttpRequest progress events fire during client-to-Spring Boot upload.
      # This is sufficient for UI - users see progress as the file uploads from browser to server.
      # Server-to-Azure streaming happens after client upload completes.

      # Delay multipart parsing until accessed - helps with memory for large uploads
      # When true, multipart parsing is deferred until the request is accessed, allowing streaming
